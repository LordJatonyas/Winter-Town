## Lens Protocol Installation
1. Install NVM

First, install or update nvm using *ONE* of the following scripts:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```
*OR*
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```
You may experience the following when reopening a terminal:
> zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
> Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?

To fix this, run the following:
```
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/zsh
```
```
sudo chown -R root:staff /usr/local/share/zsh
```

After that, install the latest version of node with the following:
```
nvm install node
```
